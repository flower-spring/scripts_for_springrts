# Widget for springrts

## Purpose:
This widget should avoid camera blocked with only few capacity to move when middle mouse button is clicked with overhead camera mode or fps camera mode or rot overhead camera mode, and if middle mouse button is not holded. But by enabling this widget, it should disable for you the possibility, at least in overhead camera mode, to navigate on map by holding middle mouse button.
(This behaviour of "blocked camera" could occur with overhead camera mode or fps camera mode or rot overhead camera mode, and if middle mouse button is not holded.)

## Installation:
For made this widget to works, 
- if you are under windows, you should put it in C:\Users\your_current_account_name\Documents\My Games\Spring\LuaUI\Widgets.
- if you are under linux, I'm unsure, but I think you should put it in ~./spring/LuaUI/Widgets
You should see the widget ingame in the list after pressed the F11 key.
Widget should appears after the widgets wrote with an asterisk at the end. The name of this widget should be "Middle mouse button".
